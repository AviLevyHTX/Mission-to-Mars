## Objective
After assisting Robin to obtain information about Mars by scraping the data, compiling it, and then displaying it, the next task is to adjust the web app to collect images of Mars's four hemispheres. Similar to before, the images of the hemispheres will be scraped from the site and then eventually displayed using a web application.



## Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
(Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, you’ll scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images.)

## Update the Web App with Mars’s Hemisphere Images and Titles
(Using your Python and HTML skills, you’ll add the code you created in Deliverable 1 to your scraping.py file, update your Mongo database, and modify your index.html file so the webpage contains all the information you collected in this module as well as the full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image.)


## Add Bootstrap 3 Components
(For this part of the Challenge, update your web app to make it mobile-responsive, and add two additional Bootstrap 3 components to make it stand out.)
